# star_wars_api
This application shows the different characters of star wars and the movies of the franchise where they make appearances


This application allows you to see the characters of the star wars franchise in the cinema (the entire canon is not contemplated at the moment), with their respective films in which they participate.

It also allows you to add characters, edit them or delete them (a flag is left active to implement the option to disable in the future)

In addition to this there is also the possibility of creating movies with their corresponding information including planets that appear in it (this last feature also has a CRUD)

To know this in depth, you can enter {{url}}/swagger/
